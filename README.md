# A/B test case: difficulty curve optimization in a Match-3 game

In a Match-3 game, each level has its own difficulty. The difficulty curve describes how the level difficulty changes throughout the sequence of levels. The game development team decided to test some changes to this curve and evaluate the following **hypotheses**:

● Lowering the difficulty of early levels will reduce player churn but may decrease monetization at these levels, as players will have less need to make purchases.

● Gradually increasing the difficulty of later levels will help compensate for the monetization drop.

The team ran an A/B test on new players (the date a player entered the test matches the date they installed the game). The duration of the test was 60 days.
